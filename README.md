## Short summary
Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier handling in R to prepare a recipe traffic dataset for downstream modeling, applying statistical validation and visual inspection to ensure balanced inputs.

## Technical summary
Built a reproducible preprocessing pipeline in R (tidyverse, ggplot2) to validate data types, handling missing values, and standardize categorical features. Applied quantile-based trimming for outlier removal on skewed nutritional columns and engineered binary target labels for high-traffic classification. Conducted exploratory analysis with grouped aggregations, correlation checks, and visualizations to ensure feature consistency and readiness for supervised learning workflows.

## History
Some projects aren’t about difficulty but about what they represent. My Data Scientist Exam was exactly that, a milestone I postponed for a long time, waiting for the right moment. It symbolized the end of my learning phase and the start of my expert journey. The exam itself was easy, but it left me with a real sense of accomplishment and proof that I had truly grown.
